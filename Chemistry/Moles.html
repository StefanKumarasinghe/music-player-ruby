<h1>Moles & Avogadro's Constant</h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>We will need to know the basic definitions that exams ask</p>
<br id="reference1">
<h2>Relative atomic mass - A<sub>r</sub></h2>
<h3>The average mass of a natural occurring atom of an element on a scale where a carbon atom has exactly 12 units</h3>
<p>You can use this definition or the below one</p>
<h3>The average mass of a natural occurring atom of an element compared to 1/12 th of a mass of a carbon - 12 atom</h3>
<p>A good point to remember is that the mass of  1/12 of C - 12 atom is 1</p>
<p>MCQ's can give it in different ways such as the examples below</p>
<h4>R.A.M = Average mass of an atom / ((1/12) * 12)</h4>
<p>Same as:</p>
<h4>R.A.M = Average mass of an atom *12 / 12</h4>
<p>You will need to know how to calculate the relative atomic mass of an atom using different values of Isotopic masses. First let us see what is Isoptopic mass</p>
<br id="reference2">
<h2>Isotopes</h2>
<h3>Isotopes are atoms of the same element which has the same number of protons but different number of neutrons</h3>
<p>For example the carbon element has 3 isotopes which are C-12 , C-13 and C-14. These all have the same number of protons because the proton number is used to uniquely identify each element</p>
<p>However, they all have different neutron numbers which results in different mass numbers also ( As mass/nucleon number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom)</p>
<p>More of isotopes will be discussed later</p>
<br id="reference3">
<h2>Isotopic mass</h2>
<h3>The mass of an atom of that particular isotope of an element</h3>
<p>So you may see that different isotopes have different mass number. The mass number of each atom is called the isotopic mass and it is different for each isotope</p>
<br id="reference4">
<h2>Relative Molecular Mass - M<sub>r</sub></h2>
<h3>It is the mass of a molecule of a substance on a scale where carbon - 12 atom has exactly 12 units</h3>
<p>You can also use the other definition if you want</p>
<p>This is found by adding the individual relative atomic masses of atoms in a molecule. For example HCl - 38.5</p>
<br id="reference5">
<h2>Relative Formula Mass - M<sub>r</sub></h2>
<h3>The mass of a formula of a substance on a scale where carbon - 12 atom has exactly 12 units</h3>
<p>This is very similar to RMM however we use it in a different situation. We use it only for compounds and giant ionic structures</p>
<p>For example the relative formular mass of NaCl is  58.5</p>
<p>Also remember this is not molar mass but they both have the same values - this is because molar mass has units but RFM has no units</p>
<p>Also the relative formula mass is calculated depending on the formula given - keep in this mind as when the formula simplifies (empirical) it has a different value</p>
<br id="reference6">
<h2>Moles</h2>
<h3>1 mole of any substance has 6.02 * 10<sup>23</sup> atoms , molecules or formula units. This is also known as Avogadro's constant</h3>
<p>This is how you must be defined</p>
<p>The reason why we use molecules , atoms or formula units is that this depends on the type of structure of the substance.</p>
<p>We will see 3 examples below</p>
<p>Let us take 1 mole of NaCl. This should contain 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> of what?</p>
<p>If it was a ionic compound like NaCl then it will give 6 * 10<sup>23</sup>  formula units or groups of NaCl.</p>
<p>So this means there are 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> ions <span class="highlight">and</span> also 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> ions</p>
<br>
<p>Let's take a different example. Let's see 1 mole of Magnesium</p>
<p>This means that there are 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> Mg<sup>+</sup> ions in the sample but because it is neutral we can say that it has 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> Mg atoms</p>
<br>
<p>Lastly, let's see 1 mole of Hydrogen gas</p>
<p>You need to know hydrogen exists as a diatomic moleculeof H<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>So 1 mole of H<sub>2</sub> will give us 6 * 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of hydrogen gas</p>
<p>To find the total number of atoms we just need to multiply by 2 as each molecule has 2 hydrogen atom</p>
<h2>Important Equations</h2>
<p>Now you need to know the most important equations in this chapter</p>
<ul>
<br id="reference7">
<li>Finding the number of moles</li>
<p>To find the number of moles just divide the mass of the sample by its molar mass(relative formula mass)</p>
<h4>Moles = Mass/Molar Mass</h4>
<h4>n = m / M</h4>
<p>The reason we use molar mass is because it has units of g/mol. So this gives us the correct units for moles</p>
<p>Also remember we use grams as the units for mass</p>
<br id="reference8">
<li>Finding the concentration</li>
<p>Just divide moles by the number of by the volume of the solution</p>
<h4>C = n / V</h4>
<p>The units of the concentration is moldm<sup>-3</sup></p>
<p>This definition of concentration is very important especialy when talking about how rate is affected by the concentration</p>
<br id="reference9">
<h2>Mass Spectrometry</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/spectrometry.gif" alt="this is a well labelled diagram of the mass spectrometer">
<p>The mass spectrometer is a machine which used to calculate the relative atomic masses of fragments and atoms of different isotopes</p>
<p>We will see how we can use the mass spectrometer to calculate the relative atomic masses by finding the average of the isotopic masses</p>
<p>Before that, we need to know the parts of a mass spectrometer:</p>
<li>Ioniser and Vaporiser</li>
<p>This part vaporises the elements to form gaseous atoms which are then bombarded with fast moving electrons. This causes the gaseous atoms to become ionised.</p>
<li>Accelerator or an Electric field</li>
<p>This contains an electric field which accelerates the ions so they will all have the same kinetic energy</p>
<p>The masses will be different so it will result in different speeds</p>
<p>Remember that the work done by an electric field is irrespective of the mass. See <a href="https://revisezone.com/Html/Physics/ElectricFields.html#reference91">more</a></p>

<li>Deflector</li>
<p>This is a Tube which contains a magnetic field. This is used to deflect the ions depending on their mass to charge ratio</p>
<p>The Deflection depends on a quantity called mass-charge ratio</p>
<p>If the mass-charge ratio is greater then the deflection is less</p>
<h4>Deflection &prop; 1/(mass/charge)</h4>
<p>How do you calculate the mass to charge ratio of an ion!</p>
<p>We take the Nucleon number of the ion and divide it by the charge. For example, if I have a Na+ ion which has a nucleon number of 23 then the mass to charge ratio is also 23</p>
<h4>23 = 23/1</h4>
<p>For most examples and questions, we assume that the charge is +1 only and not greater. This means that the mass to charge ratio is equal to the nucleon number or the isoptic mass of an atom</p>
<p>To summarise, Deflection increases with charge and decreases with mass.</p>
<li>Detector</li>
<p>The position of the ions and particles is detected by the detector and is recorded. This depends on the deflection of the ion(mass-charge ratio) but, we assume the charge is always +1</p>
<p>So usually on the detector, ions of the same mass will hit in the same place where as ions of different masses hits in a different place</p>
<p>Usually in exams, they will give an intensity graph where the intensity of each isotopic mass ( same as the mass of the ion ) is given</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/relativeabundance.png" alt="relative abundance graph">
<figcaption>This is the relative abundance graph where we use percentage instead of intensity but, the same could be applied with an intensity graph</figcaption>
<p>When the intensity is higher and at a greater peak then the relative abudance of the isotope of the element is greater, This means that there is a higher percentage of finding this particular isotope of an element</p>
<p>Here is the equation:</p>
<h4>RAM = (Isotopic mass<sub>1</sub> * Intensity<sub>1</sub> + Isotopic mass<sub>2</sub> * Intensity<sub>2</sub> +...) / Total Intensity</h4>
<p>There maybe many isoptopes for the same element and all will be different</p>
<p>This is gives the average mass of all the isotopes of an element depending on their relative abudance or percentage</p>
<p>The same could be achieved using percentages</p>
<p>We will use an example for this</p>
<blockquote>There are two isoptopes of Sodium. Na - 23 has a relative abudance of 98% whereas Na- 24 has an abundance of 2%. Find the relative atomic mass of Sodium</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>RAM = (23 * 98 + 24 * 2 ) / 100</h4>
<h4>RAM = 23.02</h4>
<p>Focus on where 98 and 2 adds up to 100. This is divided by 100</p>
<p>You can do it this way also which is basically the same thing</p>
<h4>RAM = 23 * 98% + 24 * 2%</h4>
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss what is empirical and molecular formula and how we calculate them</p>
