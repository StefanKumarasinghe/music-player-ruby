<h1>Alkenes</h1>
<h3>They are Unsaturated Hydrocarbons with the General Formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub></h3>
<p>This is a structure of Propene:</p>
<img class="resize" src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/propene.png" alt="propene">
<figcaption>Structure of propene</figcaption>
<p>These are called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have atleast one carbon to carbon double bond. This makes the substance very reactive due to the high density of electrons in the double bond. This acts as an nucleophile and is easily attacked by electrophiles. In fact, most of the reactions of alkenes are called electrophillic addition</p>
<p>Due to the carbon double bond, it makes the region slightly negative charged and so electrophiles are attracted to it </p>
<p>But before we talk about the mechanisms and reactions, we need to know what an electrophile and nucleophile is</p>
<br id="reference207">
<h2>Electrophile</h2>
<h3>An atom or an ion that is partially positive charged and accepts a pair of electron</h3>
<p>The common examples are carbocations, H<sup>+</sup> or partially positive charged atoms &delta;</p>
<br id="reference208">
<h2>Nucleophile</h2>
<h3>Substance that donates a pair of electron</h3>
<p>Good examples are negatively charged ions or carbon double bonds or even atoms with lone pairs</p>
<p>A common example is Ammonia</p>
<br id="reference209">
<h2>Reactivity of Alkenes</h2>
<p>Like we said the reactivity of alkenes depends mainly on the carbon to carbon double bond. As it is easily attacked by electrophiles. Also the 2nd bond in the double bond is weaker than the first ( &pi; bond is weaker than the sigma bond ). So they usually break easily to form new bonds</p>
<p>Most of the reactions of alkenes are called electrophillic addition. This is because the mechanism is due to the electrophiles attacking the C=C bond and the reaction is an addition reaction. If you want to know the types of organic reaction we recommend you to visit the previous chapter</p>

<h2>Normal Reactions of Alkenes</h2>
<p>We will need to know some of the reaction mechanisms but, not for all reactions. In this part, we will discuss the basic reactions which you only need to know the equation and products but not the mechanisms</p>
<br id="reference210">
<li>Combustion</li>
<p>There is incomplete and Complete combustion. You will need to know the products for each reaction so we will take ethene as the example</p>
<p>When Ethene react in excess oxygen (Complete Combustion):</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + 3O<Sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<Sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<figcaption>Complete combustion will produce both carbon dioxide and water</figcaption>
<p>When Ethene is burnt in limited oxygen, it has several different equations:</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + 2O<Sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2CO+ 2H<Sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + O<Sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2C+ 2H<Sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<p>The reason why I have given two equations is that sometimes the questions may ask the production of a black substance only which is carbon ( or soot )</p>
<p>But the general equation is the first one</p>
<br id="reference211">
<li>Oxidation of Alkene</li>
<p>This is a more slower way of oxidising alkenes and we use either Hot Concentrated acidified KMnO<sub>4</sub> or Dilute Cold acidified KMnO<sub>4</sub>. Each of these conditions will result in different products</p>
<h2>Hot Concentrate Acidified KMnO<sub>4</sub></h2>
<p>Due to the high temperature, the carbon double bond breaks or splits resulting into two seperate molecules. Then Oxygen atom bonds with these carbon atoms so we get a C=O group in each seperate molecule. The products also depends on the position of the double bond in the alkene</p>
<p>The below diagrams will summarise all the possible products</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/oxidationalkene.png" alt="oxidation of alkenes">
<p>To simply put it, if the double bond is attached to the 1st carbon atom. Then the products must give out CO<sub>2</sub> & H<sub>2</sub>O and some other products</p>
<p>The understanding is very simple. What you have to do is to split the alkene at the double bond which results two molecules then bond a oxygen atom. This could either create carbon dioxide, water, ketones or an aldehyde</p>
<p>You don't need to know what are ketones or aldehydes right now but, remember they are carbonyl coumpounds with the C=O group </p>
<h2>Dilute Cold Acidified KMnO<sub>4</sub></h2>
<p>In this the &pi; bond in the carbon double bond breaks ( this does not split or fully break ) and this bonds with and OH group. It is very similar to an alkane instead the the  hydrogen atoms are OH groups. Also keep in mind that as the double bond breaks. This leaves two carbons not bonded so two groups of OH groups will attach to form a diol</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/diol.png" alt="oxidation of alkenes">
<br id="reference212">
<h2>Electrophillic Addition</h2>
<p>For these addition reactions, the mechanisms are required</p>
<p>All of these below reactions are addition reaction which means only a single product is formed. These reactions involve the addition of:</p>
<p>1. Hydrogen</p>
<p>2. Water/Steam</p>
<p>3. Halogen</p>
<p>4. Hydrogen Halide</p>
<p>We will discuss each one in depth now:</p>
<br id="reference213">
<li>Addition of Hydrogen / Hydrogenation</li>
<p> We will take ethene as the example:</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> +H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub></h4>
<p>So during the reaction the double bond breaks and the two hydrogen atoms will bond to the carbon atoms</p>
<p>The below is the mechanism of the reaction. Make sure you remember how to draw this:</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/hydrogenation.jpg" alt="hydrogenation of ethene">
<figcaption>Graphical representation of the mechanism<figcaption>
<br>
<p>Catalyst: Heated Nickel</p>
<p>Temperature: 150&deg;C</p>
<p>But the main problem is locating the electrophile. Hydrogen is non polar so why will it attack the double bond. This is because, when the hydrogen molecule gets close to the high electron density carbon double bond, a partial positive charge is INDUCED on one of the hydrogen atoms. This is the same for other molecules such as bromine</p>
<br id="reference214">
<li>Addition of Water or steam / Hydration</li>
<p>When the water molecule reacts and give its OH group to the alkene to form an alcohol</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> +H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH</h4>
<figcaption>The OH group and hydrogen is added to the molecule</figcaption>
<br>
<p>This is the mechanism of the reaction in this case the lone pair of the water molecule acts as the electrophile</p>

<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/hydration.jpg" alt="hydration of ethene">
<figcaption>Graphical representation of the mechanism<figcaption>
<p>Catalyst: Phosphoric acid</p>
<p>Temperature: 300&deg;C</p>
<p>Pressure: 60atm  or 6 Million Pascals</p> 
<br id="reference215">
<li>Addition of Halogen or Br<sub>2</sub> / Bromination</li>
<p>This is very similar to addition of hydrogen but instead this is two bromine atoms</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> +Br<sub>2</sub> &rarr; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>2</sub></h4>
<figcaption>Formation of 1,2-dibromoethane</figcaption>
<br>
<p>The mechanism is similar to the hydrogen but we use bromine instead. Also this could be applied for any other halogen in the same way</p>

<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/bromination.jpg" alt="bromination of ethene">
<figcaption>Graphical representation of the mechanism<figcaption>
<p>This reaction can occur at room temperature and is used as a test for alkene or unsaturated compounds because the bromine liquid / water decolorises</p>
<br id="reference216">
<li>Addition of Hydrogen Halide</li>
<p>This seems more obvious as the molecule is certainly polar and so the Halide atom will be partially negative charged and act as an electrophile</p>
<h4>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + HBr &rarr; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br</h4>
<figcaption>Formation of bromoethane</figcaption>
<br>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/halidemechanism.jpg" alt="halogenation of ethene">
<figcaption>Graphical representation of the mechanism<figcaption>
<p>This is also very similar to addition of bromine gas but in this case there is only a hydrogen and bromine atom.</p>
<p>Reaction also occurs at room temperature</p>
<br id="reference217">
<h2>Notes and Reminders</h2>
<p>You need to know that the mechanisms are very important and we use full curly arrow to show the movement of the electrons</p>
<p>The key to getting high marks is to follow the rules properly. We need to start the arrow either from the middle of the bond or from a lone pair. This is a must because these arrows show the movement of arrows</p>
<p>Remember to label the dipole charges and moments on the molecules</p>
<p>We use full arrows to show it is a hetrolytic fission and not homolytic fission</p>
<br id="reference218">
<h2>Stability Rule</h2>
<p>Using Markovnikov's rule we can predict the possible products that will have the higher concentration depending on its stability. Here is an example:</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/mrule.jpg" alt="stability of alkenes">
<p>So the carbocation that is the most stable will be more abundant and have a higher concentration. This is not visible with bromine or hydrogen molecules only but with molecules of different atoms. This is because, in this case the atoms may rearrange in different orders</p>
