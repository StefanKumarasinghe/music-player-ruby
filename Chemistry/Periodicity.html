<h1>Periodicity Notes</h1>

<p>Across any period in a periodic table, there is an recurring pattern or trend for each property. We will discuss the main trends and patterns you need to know. We will use period 3 as our main example because this is what most exams follow</p>
<br id="reference95">
<h2>Ionisation Energies across the period</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/ionisationtrend.png" alt="trend of ionisation energy in period 3">
<p>Across the period, the Ionisation energies generally increases. This is because, the shielding effect is more or less the same as electrons are added to the same principle Quantum shell and the atomic radius slightly decreases. Also the nucleur charge or the proton number increases causing a greater nucleur charge and attraction forces between the nucleus and the valence electrons. So more energy is required</p>
<br>
<p>The above explanation is enough to score marks. However, this is the general trend and so there are some exception you need to know</p>
<br id="reference96">
<h2>Exceptions to the rule</h2>
<p>The exception are only for group 2,3 and group 5,6 elements</p>
<p>As you guessed it, group 3 elements has a slightly lower ionisation energies than the group 2 elements. Why? We will see the answer below</p>
<br>
<p>The electrons of group 3 elements is added to the P subshell instead of the S orbital. So due to slight increase in atomic radius and shielding effect being more significant than the increase in nucleur charge. The effective nucleur charge decreases and so lower attractive force</p>
<p>If you are answering a question, ensure that you mention the principal quantum shells of the Subshells you are talking about. For example, 3P and 3S. Also remember to use the word <span class="highlight">"significant"</span> in your answer as it is very important</p>
<p>Now we will go to the group 5, 6 exception</p>
<p>The group 6 has a lower ionisation energy compared to group 5 elements. The reason is a bit different and it includes the 4th factor</p>
<p>For group 6 elements, the electron is paired with another electron whereas for group 5 elements the p subshell is half filled with individual electrons. So due to the spin-pair repulsion of the electrons, it reduces the effective nucleur charge or attraction forces and so less energy is required</p>
<br>
<p>This idea is very important, that is why remember that group 5 elements have a half filled P subshell</p>
<p>This pattern works for almost across any period. So that's why it is part of the periodicity notes!</p>
<br id="reference97">
<h2>Trends down the group</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/ionisation.png" alt="ionisation trend down the group">
<figcaption>The peaks represent the group 8 elements and it decreases as you go</figcaption>
<p>To simply put it the ionisation energies decrease down the group. Why? We will see the answer</p>
<p>The increase in atomic radius and the increase in shielding effect due to increase in inner core electrons is more significant than the increase in nucleur charge or proton number. So the effective nucleur charge and the attraction forces between the electrons and the nucleus decreases and so the ionisation energy decreases</p>
<p>It is that simple and that's all you need to know! Make sure you use the word significant!</p>
<br id="reference98">
<h2>Electronegativity Trends<h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/electronegativity.jpg" alt="The electronegativity of elements across a period">
<p>There is a clear increase in electronegativity across the period. Note that this does not follow the trend as the ionisation energy but the reasons are almost identical</p>
<p>Also NOF are the most electronegative elements</p>
<br id="reference99">
<h2>How is Atomic Radius determined</h2>
<p>For different types of bonding the atomic radius is found differently:</p>
<li>Metallic bonding</li>
<p>Half of the distance between the centers of the two positive cations</p>
<li>Covalent bonding / Diatomic</li>
<p>Half of the distance between the centers of the  two nuclei that is covalently bonded.</p>
<p>This will not give a precise radius as the orbitals are overlapping</p>
<li>Monoatomic</li>
<p>Half of the distance between the centers of two atoms touching</p>
<br id="reference100">
<h2>Trends in Atomic Radius</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/radiustrend.png" alt="atomic radius trend across a period">
<figcaption>This concept is very important as the elements on the left are the largest ones</figcaption>
<p>Atomic radius is a periodicity section but, we will still discuss it as it is related to ionisation energies</p>
<p>All you need to know that across a period, the atomic radius of elements decreases. Why? This is because, due to the increase in nucleur charge and shielding effect is more or less constant, there is greater attraction forces between the valence electrons and the nucleus and so greater pull. So the radius decreases</p>
<p>You will need to remember this graph and this is similar for any period</p>
<p>Exams question by asking to compare the atomic radius of 2 elements. For example, which one is larger in size, Na or Al. Even though it is tempting to think that because Al has more subshells, the atomic radius of Aluminium is less than Sodium. So Sodium is larger in size</p>
<br id="reference101">
<h2>Trends in Ionic Radius</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/ionictrend.png" alt="ionic radius trend across a period">
<figcaption>This shows the trend for 2 periods. This shows how the pattern is the same for the two periods. This is the idea of periodicity </figcaption>
<p>When comparing Ionic Radius, it is a bit different. Usually when elements form ions, they form the most stable electronic configuration</p>
<p>The Ionic radius of elements across a period also decreases but the anions have a larger radius than the cations. Remember the graph!</p>
<p>This is because, the anion has an extra principle quantum shell to hold more electrons and also there is greater shielding effect from inner core electrons</p>
<p>But for both Cations and Anions the Ionic radius decreases because the nucleur charge increases and the shielding effect is constant and so greater attraction and pull</p>
<br id="reference102">
<h2>Comparison between Ionic and Atomic Radius</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/ionicatomic.jpg" alt="difference between the ionic and atomic radius">
<p>When we compare the Ionic or the atomic radius of a particular element, you need to consider whether it is a Anion or a cation!</p>
<p>Simply the cations has a smaller radius than the corresponding atom. Why? This is because, the cation has less electrons than the atom and so there is less repulsion force between electrons causing a greater EFFECTIVE nucleur charge on the valence electrons</p>
<p>The Anions has a larger radius than the corresponding atoms because, the anions have more electrons and so greater repulsion forces. This leads to a lower EFFECTIVE Nucleur charge on valence electrons so the radius is more larger</p>
<p>That's all you need to know. Please use the explanations above as they are from the markshemes!</p> 
<br id="reference103">
<h2>Reactions with Oxygens</h2>
<p>We will see how elements across the period react with oxygen. We will take period 3 as the example</p>
<pre>
Na - Burns with a yellow flame
Mg - Burns with a bright white flame
Al - Slowly oxidises
Si - Slowly oxidises
P  - Burns with a yellow flame
S - Burns with a blue flame
</pre>
<figcaption>All of these produces a white solid oxide</figcaption>
<br id="reference104">
<h2>Solubility of oxides</h2>
<p>We will now see how the solubility of oxides changes across a period</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th>Compound</th>
<th>Solubility</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Na<sub>2</sub>O</td>
<td>Very Soluble</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>MgO</td>
<td>Slightly Soluble</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></td>
<td>Insoluble</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>SiO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>Insoluble</td>
<tr>
<td>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></td>
<td>Soluble</td>

</tr>
<td>SO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>Soluble</td>

</tr>



</table>
<br id="reference105">
<h2>pH of Oxides</h2>
<p>The pH of the oxide depends on whether the compound is ionic or covalent</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th>Compound</th>
<th>Nature</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Na<sub>2</sub>O</td>
<td>Basic</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>MgO</td>
<td>Basic</td>

<td>Ampthoreic</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>SiO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>Acidic</td>
<tr>
<td>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></td>
<td>Acidic</td>

</tr>
<td>SO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>Acidic</td>

</tr>



</table>
<p>You need to know that Aluminium oxide and Silicon dioxide does not dissolve but does react</p>
<p>When a metal oxide such as sodium dissolve in water, OH<sup>-</sup> ions are released.</p>
<h4>O<sup>2-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 2OH<sup>-</sup></h4>
<p>That is why Na<sub>2</sub>O and MgO are basic...</p>
<br id="reference106">
<h2>Period 3 Chlorides</h2>
<p>There is a clear trend in the acidity of chlorides in water across the period</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th>Compound</th>
<th>pH</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>NaCl</td>
<td>7</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>MgCl<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>6</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub></td>
<td>4</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>SiCl<sub>4</sub></td>
<td>3</td>
<tr>
<td>PCl<sub>5</sub></td>
<td>3</td>

</tr>
<td>SCl<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>3</td>

</tr>



</table>
<p>What you need to remember is that all Chlorides except the group 1 chlorides are acidic. Group 1 Chlorides are always neutral, the acidicity increases across the period and you need to know these pH values for each element</p>
<p>Another Point to remember is that, the chlorides are HYDROLYSED by water which is a reaction that makes the solution acidic. Only Sodium Chloride does not hydrolyse but just dissolves in water</p>
<br id="reference107">
<h2>Oxidation Number of Chlorides & Oxides</h2>
<p>We need to remember that the more electronegative atoms are always negatively charged. We will see the Oxidation of each element in their chlorides:</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th>Compound</th>
<th>Oxidation Number</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>NaCl</td>
<td>+1</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>MgCl<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>+2</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub></td>
<td>+3</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>SiCl<sub>4</sub></td>
<td>+4</td>
<tr>
<td>PCl<sub>5</sub></td>
<td>+5</td>

</tr>
<td>SCl<sub>6</sub></td>
<td>+6</td>

</tr>



</table>
<p>We will see the oxidation number of Oxides. It is very similar</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Na<sub>2</sub>O</td>

<td>+5</td>

</tr>
<td>S0<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>+4</td>

</tr>

<h2>Trends in Bonding of Elements</h2>
<p>The physical properties usually depend on the bonding involved in each group. Usually, there is a same type of bonding for each group</p>

<p>By using this, we can predict the trend of the melting and electric conductivity across the period.</p>
<br id="reference109">
<h2>Melting and Boiling points</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/melting.png" alt="The boiling of elements across a period">
<p>The melting point from Group 1 to Group 5 increases. We will see why</p>
<p>The Group 1 , 2 & 3 have metallic bonding but from group 1 to 3, the charge of the ions formed by the metals increases ( Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup> ). So higher the charge, the higher the charge density and greater electrostatic forces between metal ions. This makes it much more stronger and have a higher melting point.</p>
<p>For group 4, as it is a giant covalent structure (full of covalent bonds), this makes the structure extremely strong and have the highest melting &  boling point</p>
<p>For group after the Group 4, the melting point decreases as they are simple molecular strucures. However, the group 6 element has a slightly higher boiling and melting point than its usual trend.</p>
<br id="reference110">
<h2>Electric Conductivity</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Chemistry/electric.jpg" alt="The electric conductivity of elements across a period">
<p>This also depends on the bonding.  From group 1 to 3, the electric conductivity increases as the metal ions have a greater charge and so there is more free delocalised electrons to carry charge.</p>
<p>From group 3 onwards the electric conductivity decreases. This is because giant covalent and simple molecular structures do not have free mobile electrons to carry charge</p>
