<h1>Equilibrium & Reversible Reactions</sub></h1>

<br id="reference72">
<h2>Reversible Reaction</h2>
<h3>A reaction that either can go backwards or forwards</h3>
<p>A reversible reaction can also be when the backward or forward reaction are occuring simultaneously but, this is not a must</p>
<p>A good example is the hydration of copper sulfate. This is done when you add water to the Anhydrous copper sulfate :</p>
<h4> CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr;  CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<figcaption>This releases a lot of heat and turns the added water to steam. There is also a color change from white to blue</figcaption>
<p>The reaction could go back also:</p>
<h4>  CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<figcaption>This is done when the  hydrated salt is heated. The color changes from blue to white</figcaption>
<p>This could be combined to one reversible reaction</p>
<h4> CuSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#8651;  CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O</h4>
<p>Notice the forward and the backward reactions don't occur simultaneously and also this reaction is used as a <span class="highlight">chemical</span> test for water</p>
<p>The &#8651; sign indicates it is a reversible reaction</p>
<br id="reference73">
<h2>Dynamic Equilibirium</h2>
<p>This is a special type of reversible reaction:</p>
<h3>When the rate of the forward and backward reaction are the same and so the concentration of products and reactants remains constant</h3>
<p>There are more conditions for an equilibirium to occur:</p>
<ul>
<br id="reference74">
<li>Must be in a Closed system</li>
<h3>A system in which no matter or energy enters or leaves the system</h3>
<p>The Google definition for a closed system is not suitable as it says energy can leave out of the system but, the marksheme definition is the one above</p>
<p>A closed system could be either a solution in which the products and reactants are in aqueous forms or it could be gases trapped in a container</p>

<li>It is Dynamic</li>
<h3>When both the reactants and products are continuously reacting simultaneously</h3>
<p>This shows that the rate of forward and backward reaction are not Zero but happening continously. In other words the net rate is Zero as it cancels out</p>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In fact, when a question ask what is a "Dynamic Equilibirium"? It is best if you include all of these points:</p>
<h3>When the rate of the forward and backward reaction are the same and is continously reacting simultaneously and so the concentration of products and reactants remains constant. It also occurs in a closed system</h3>
<br id="reference75">
<h2>Equilibirium Position</h2>
<p>An equilibrium position is not a real thing but an idea of relativity</p>
<p>For example is a equilibrium, if there are more products formed than the reactants, then we say the equilibrium position is to the right or shifted to the right</p>
<p>If there are more reactants formed than the products, then we say the equilibrium position is to the left or shifted to the left</p>
<p>Usually the concentration of products and reactants are not equal or the same. They remain constant and it is usually rare for them to be the same</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting the Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Before we go through the factors that affect the equilibrium, we must go through a very important principle which is used to explain the effects of each factor</p>
<br id="reference76">
<h2>Le Chatelier's principle</h2>
<h3>When two or more factors affecting the equilibrium are changed, the equilibrium position shifts to the direction that opposes the change made to it</h3>
<p>The system does not like to change and any change made to it will be opposed by the system to reduce the change made to it. You will understand more as we give the factors:</p>
<p>Below are the factors which affect the equilibrium position of the system. These are the model answers so follow these:</p>
<pre>
N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> &#8651; 2NH<sub>3</sub></sub>
<figcaption>This an example used to explain the below factors</figcaption>
</pre> 
<ul>
<br id="reference77">
<br>
<li>Concentration</li>
<p>Refer the above example</p>
<p>Increasing the concentration of N<sub>2</sub> will cause the equilibrium position to be disturbed. The system will try to oppose it by decreasing the concentration of N<sub>2</sub> by increasing the forward reaction rate. The equilibrium position shifts to the right and more NH<sub>3</sub> is formed</p>
<li>Pressure</li>
<p>When you increase the pressure, the equilibrium is disturbed. The system will try to reduce the pressure by favouring/ increasing the rate  towards fewer molecules. So this increase the rate of the forward reaction and so equilibrium position shifts to the right and produce more NH<sub>3</sub></p>
<li>Temperature</li>
<p>The above forward reaction is exothermic</p>
<p>When the temperature is increased the equilibrium is disturb and the system will try to decrease the temperature by increase the rate of the endothermic reaction which is the backward reaction. So the equilibrium position shifts to the left and produce more N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub></p>
<h2>Further Explanation</h2>
<p>If you don't understand, do not worry we will explain!</p>
<p>The 1st Factor is pretty straight forward and it applies to different situation also</p>
<p>For example if we reduce the concentration of N<sub>2</sub> the rate of backward reaction will increase to make more N<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>If we increase the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>, then the backward reaction rate increases. That is why we collect and remove Ammonia as soon as it is made</p>
<p>The 2nd factor is a bit more complicating. We did talk about this in ideal gas that P &prop; n. So more gases moles or particles in the system, the higher the pressure. So when we increase the pressure, the system has to decrease it by having less molecules in the system. As we can see the left side has 4 Molecules of gas where as the right has only 2!</p>
<p>The same concept is applied when we reduce the pressure, the system will try to increase it by having more particles in the system which is the left!</p>
<p>The 3rd factor is also easy to understand - endothermic is a cooling effect which absorbs energy and exothermic is an heating effect which releases energy. So using Le Chatelier Principle we can explain these</p>
<br id="reference78">
<h2>What about a Catalyst?</h2>
<p>Catalyst does speed the reaction but, it increases both the backward and forward reaction rate by the same amount. SO there is no net change. However, the equilibrium position or equilibrium is reached faster.</p>
<p>In other words, this does not change the yield but affects the time taken to get this yield!</p>
<br id="reference79">
<h2>No change in Equilibirium position</h2>
<p>Sometimes changing a factor may not affect its equilibrium position</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
H<sub>2(g)</sub> + I<sub>2(g)</sub> &#8651; 2HI<sub>(g)</sub>
</pre>
<p>In this case both sides have 2 moles or molecules so an increase / decrease in pressure has no affect on the equilibrium position but it will affect the rate or the rate at which the equilibrium is reached</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that, we need to count the number of GASES molecules on both side of the equaution and not other ones because, gas is the state which causes pressure (theoretically)</p>
<br id="reference80">
<h2>Equilibrium Constants</h2>
<p>An equilibrium constant is the ratio between the products and the reactants. It has a constant value for a specific temperature</p>
<p>There are 2 types of Equilibirium constants in the AS syllabus:</p>
<p>1. K<Sub>c</sub></p>
<p>1. K<Sub>p</sub></p>
<p>We will see how we can calculate and the situations we use each constant for.</p>
<br id="reference81">
<h2>K<Sub>c</sub> Constant</h2>
<p>This is how we calculate it:</p>
<pre>

        [Product]<sup>n</sup>
 K<sub>c</sub>=   ____________
        [Reactant]<sup>m</sup>


</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
H<sub>2(g)</sub> + I<sub>2(g)</sub> &#8651; 2HI<sub>(g)</sub>


           [HI]<sup>2</sup>
 K<sub>c</sub>=   ____________
          [H]<sup>1</sup>[I]<sup>1</sup>
		 
This is known as the equilibrium expression

</pre>
<p>The brackets are used to show that we take the concentration of each gas in the equilibrium and the powers is the mole ratio of that substance</p>
<p>We use this only when the number of moles or concentration of each product and reactant is given</p>
<p>The above equation is the equilibrium expression and the value is the K<Sub>c</sub> value</p>
<p>But as these are gases, we know gases exert pressure so we can introduce another constant</p>
<br id="reference82">
<h2>K<Sub>p</sub> Constant</h2>
<p>This is only used when the PARTIAL Pressures of the gases in the system are given</p>
<p>What are partial pressures?</p>
<h3>It is the pressure exert by a single type of gas in a mixture of gas</h3>
<p>For example in a container of gas, there is HI gas, I<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> gas in the mixture. Each of them exert a specific amount of pressure. For example, if the pressure of the container is 10Pa and, the partial pressure of I<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> is 2pa each. So the partial pressure of HI should be 6Pa</p>
<p>As we know, the pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles so we can calculate the partial pressures if the number of moles of each substance is given</p>
<h4>Partial Pressure = ( Number of Moles/Total Moles in the System ) * Total pressure</h4>
<p>For example in the container, there is  2 moles of I<sub>2</sub> and 2 moles of H<sub>2</sub> and 4 moles of HI. The total pressure is 10Pa. Find the partial pressure of HI:</p>
<h4>Partial Pressure of HI = ( 4/8 ) * 10 = 5 Pa</h4>
<p>After finding these partial pressures for each substance, we need to substitue them to a similar expression</p>
<pre>
H<sub>2(g)</sub> + I<sub>2(g)</sub> &#8651; 2HI<sub>(g)</sub>


           P<sup>2</sup><sub>HI</sub>
 K<sub>p</sub>=   ____________
         P<sup>1</sup><sub>H </sub>P<sup>1</sup><sub>I</sub>
		 
		 
This is known as the equilibrium expression

The P<sup>2</sup><sub>HI</sub> means partial pressure of HI to the power 2

</pre>
<p>So we only use this for gases.</p>
<br id="reference83">
<h2>Units for K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>p</sub></h2>
<p>The units can change from equation to equation</p>
<p>The units on both side of the equilibrium expression must be the same</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>

           [HI]<sup>2</sup>
 K<sub>c</sub>=   ____________
          [H]<sup>1</sup>[I]<sup>1</sup>
		  
		  
		  
In the form of units:



           moldm<sup>-3</sup>
 K<sub>c</sub>=   ____________
       moldm<sup>-3</sup> * moldm<sup>-3</sup>		  
		  
		  
</pre>
<p>So after cancelling we get   1/moldm<sup>-3</sup> which is the same as    mol<sup>-1</sup>dm<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The same could be applied for other reactions also but always remember that this can be different and sometimes there could be no units also</p>
<p>The same can be applied for K<sub>p</sub></p>
<pre>
H<sub>2(g)</sub> + I<sub>2(g)</sub> &#8651; 2HI<sub>(g)</sub>


           P<sup>2</sup><sub>HI</sub>
 K<sub>p</sub>=   ____________
         P<sup>1</sup><sub>H </sub>P<sup>1</sup><sub>I</sub>
		 
           Pa
 K<sub>p</sub>=   ____________
         Pa * Pa
		 		 
so the final units will be 1/Pa or Pa<sup>-1</sup>
</pre>
<br id="reference84">
<h2>Exam Examples & Questions</h2>
<p>We will see now some common questions in exams</p>
<blockquote>In a container of volume 2dm<sup>3</sup>, 0.1 moles of I<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 moles of H<sub>2</sub> are left to reach equilibrium. When equilibrium is reached there is 0.1 moles of HI. Find the K<sub>c</sub></blockquote>
<p>We will put this in a proper format:</p>
<pre>
                     H<sub>2(g)</sub>              I<sub>2(g)</sub>                      2HI<sub>(g)</sub>

Before               0.1                0.1                        -

At equilibrium        X                  X                        0.1

</pre>
<p>So we don't know the final moles of the reactant. To do this we first need to identify the mole ratio.</p>
<p>It is 1 : 1 : 2</p>
<p>So any moles reacted or lost in  H<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> must be doubled to form HI</p>
<p>So HI gains by 0.1 Moles that means  H<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> must decrease 0.05 moles to form 0.1 moles of HI (Basic mole ratio).</p>
<p>So:</p>
<pre>
                     H<sub>2(g)</sub>              I<sub>2(g)</sub>                      2HI<sub>(g)</sub>

Before               0.1                0.1                        -

At equilibrium      0.05                0.05                       0.1
 
<p>As 0.05 moles is reacted from the H<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub></p>
</pre>
<p>So after you find the moles for each substance, then find the concentration - remember the volume remains the same for all concentration as it is common for each</p>
<p>Then after finding the concentration. Find K<sub>c</sub></p>
<p>K<sub>p</sub> questions are much simpler but, we recommend you practice more questions</p>
