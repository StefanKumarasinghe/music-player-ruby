          <h1>Internet, WWW, Networks & Transmissions</h1>
          <h2>Network Structures</h2>
          <p>There are many different types of networks and it depends on the size of the network</p>
          <p>These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <br id="reference180">
            <li>WAN</li>
            <h3>It is Network connecting computers on different connecting sites which can be 1000's of Km wide.</h3>
            <p>That is why this is called a wide area network</p>
            <p>This is owned by the PSTN ( company ) but can be leased or used by an organisation</p>
            <p>The transmission medium is fibre optics</p>
            <p>Communications with in the network is done by switches. You don't need a router for this as a switch contains the mac address of the device connected to the switch.</p>
            <p>A router is bit more advance but we will talk about it later</p><br id="reference181">
            <li>LAN</li>
            <h3>The lan is a network connecting devices in a single room or building</h3>
            <p>An example - Office uses</p>
            <p>So this is owned by the organisation and it enables communications with in the building or room</p>
            <p>The transmission medium used are wireless or twisted pair</p>
            <p>There are many advantages in setting up a LAN as this enables communications within computers</p>
            <p>For Example you can communicate with your collegues without actually accessing the internet</p>
            <p>Also Centralised servers such as application servers and file servers can be connected to a LAN so the people can access files or softwares from these servers rather than installing the software to each individual computer. This makes it more efficient and cheaper</p>
            <p>These centralised servers highlight a very important model called the client-server model.</p><br id="reference182">
            <li>Internet</li>
            <h3>Is the largest network linking computers from geographical separate locations. It stands for interconnected network</h3>
            <p>This definition is very important infact, they usually ask what's the difference between internet and WWW</p>
            <p>All we have to know is that internet is the largest or a massive network which connects networks together such as WAN. It also uses the TCP and IP protocols.</p>
            <p>The reason why other networks don't use this protocols as the internet is a interconnected network and so it links computers of separate locations. This must be used in order for data to be sent to the correct location</p>
          </ul><br id="reference183">
          <h2>Client server model</h2>
          <p>You only need to know these points</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One computer acts as a server and it provides a specific service or application.</li>
            <li>One computer acts as a client which sends requests to the server and receives the services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This model is very important as they usually ask this.</p>
          <p>Lets take a simple example .You may know the app Google drive</p>
          <p>So Google drive helps you backup data or files onto a (file) server. This is the service provided by the server and the client is the browser or you. This is a specific type of service called cloud computing services<br></p>
          <p>The client server model can be broken into two categories</p><br id="reference184">
          <ul>
            <li>Thin client</li>
            <p>So in thin client it sends request or data to a server and the processing occurs only on the servers . Then the server will send a signal or an output to the client</p>
            <p>This is actually PHP coding</p><br id="reference185">
            <li>Thick client</li>
            <p>So in thick client the server sends the application/software onto the browser and so the proccesing occurs on the browser itself and not on the server.</p>
            <p>This is Javascript coding</p>
            <p>We use each type for different purposes such as for ecommerce or online stores we have to use thin client as data must be sent to the server. However, if we use an online calculator the browser itself can perform the processing</p><br id="reference186">
            <h2>Peer to peer network</h2>
            <p>This is fully covered in A2</p>
            <p>In this model there is no fixed server or client. Whenever a computer wants to retrieve data it is called a client or a seed. If another computer wants to access data from it, then it acts as a server.</p>
            <p>So in this model parts of the document is stored in individual computers and it is not stored in a centralised server.</p>
            <p>In other words the services are shared.</p><br>
            <h2>Advantages and disadvantage</h2>
            <p>Indeed each model has its own advantages and you need to remember this as exams ask this</p>
            <h2>Advantages of Client-Server model<br>
            <br></h2>
            <p>So as all the applications are stored in a central server. This improves the security of data and allows access rights. So users will be able to acces data if they are authorised to</p>
            <p>We can also perform centralised backups</p>
            <p>Store a virus guard to protect the data</p>
            <p>Much more efficient and cheaper as the services doesn't need to be installed on individual computers</p>
            <h2>Advantages of Peer to peer network</h2>
            <p>So usually the data is spread over many computers</p>
            <p>Part of the documents can be accessed rather than the full file</p>
            <p>It avoids congestion of the medium to the main server as not everyone will be accesing the main server simulataneuosly.</p>
            <p>And usually there are copies of data from many hosts</p><br>
            <p>The reason why I didn't mention the disadvantages as the advantages of the other options are the disadvantages</p><br id="reference187">
            <h2>Modes of Transmission</h2>
            <p>When ever they say mode of transmission there are 3 types</p>
            <li>Simplex mode</li>
            <p>Data is sent in one direction only</p>
            <p>Example is a radio station</p>
            <li>Half-Duplex</li>
            <p>When data is sent in both direction but one direction at a time</p>
            <p>Example is a walkie talkie</p>
            <li>Duplex</li>
            <p>When data is sent in both directions simultaneously</p>
            <p>Example is playing online games. The internet is basically duplex</p><br id="reference188">
            <h2>Broadcast and more..</h2>
            <p>Message or data can be transmitted different ways. If data is sent by a single device to all the devices in the network it is broadcasted.</p>
            <p>If data is sent to many destinations but selected it is multicast.</p>
            <p>If data is sent only to a single device it is unicast</p><br id="reference189">
            <h2>Topologies</h2>
            <h3>It is the configuration or structure of a network and how devices are connected</h3>
            <p>There are some main topologies which you must know and each of them have there own advantages and disadvantages.</p><br id="reference190">
            <li>Point to point</li>
            <h3>A single transmission medium between two devices</h3>
            <p>Think of a leased wire. This is actually a point to point network as you only can communicate with the other device only.</p><br id="reference191">
            <li>Bus topology</li>
            <h3>Endsystems or devices connected to a shared link.</h3>
            <p>So in this a single shared link is used to connect device to this network</p><br id="reference192">
            <li>Mesh topology</li>
            <h3>It contains direct links with in the devices.</h3>
            <p>Think about it. If you have 3 devices , one device can communicate directly to the other 2 and its the same for the other 2 devices. In this data can be sent only to a single device or all</p><br id="reference193">
            <li>Star topology</li>
            <h3>Devices connected to a central device</h3>
            <p>Think of a router. Usually all the devices are connected to this central device</p>
          </ul>
          <h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Bus topology</li>
            <p>Advantages</p>
            <p>The performance of the network or other devices is not affected when a device connected to the network fails</p>
            <p>Also fewer cabling is used compare to the other topologies as a single shared wire is used. So more cheaper</p><br>
            <p>Disadvantages</p>
            <p>However if the shared link is damaged the whole network fails</p>
            <p>Higher chance of congestion as single wire is used so slow transmission</p>
            <p>Also the message is broadcasted and so it is less secure</p>
            <li>Mesh Topology</li>
            <p>Advantages</p>
            <p>This allows direct communication with in the system and so faster and more secure transmission</p>
            <p>If a device fails it doesn't affect the network</p><br>
            <p>Disadvantages</p>
            <p>Requires alot of cabling so highly expensive and unrealistic</p>
            <li>Star topology</li>
            <p>Advantages</p>
            <p>Doesn't affect the perfomance of the network if an endsystem fails</p>
            <p>More secure as the central device can filter the data</p><br>
            <p>Disadvantages</p>
            <p>If central device fails the whole network fails</p>
            <p>Requires alot of cabling as devices must be connected to the central device</p>
            <p>Depending on the central device there could be data collisions and corruption and so less secure</p><br id="reference194">
            <h2>Hybrid Network</h2>
            <h3>It is a collections of LAN's which contains different supporting technologies or topologies</h3>
            <p>Example is when a Bus topology is connected to a star topology we then call it a hybrid Network</p>
            <p>Usually as a whole the internet is a hybrid network</p><br>
