<h1>Charges, Electric Fields & Field Strengths</h1>
<p>This chapter discusses about stored charges instead of moving charges ( Electricity ).</p>
<h2>Basics?</h2>
<p> All charges produces an electric field around it like magnets!</p>
<img src = "../../Imagedata/Physics/chargefields.png"  alt="All point charges or charges exert a electric field around it!">
<p>You need to know the basic concepts in electric fields such as the basic definitions and ideas but, let's start with the most basic truth</p>
<h2>Point charges</h2>
<p>We see two positive charges below. They do not attract but, repel. This is the same for two negative charges</p>
<img src = "../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldcombined2.png" alt="The forces between two negative charges and the electric field lines between two negative charges">
<p>However, two unlike charges such as a positive and a negative charge wil attract each other</p>
<p> We need to know what are electric field lines of a point charges</p>
<p> Always the electric field goes from positive to negative</p>
<img src = "../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldcombined.png" alt="electric field lines between oppositely charged charges and the attraction">
<p>Point charges have a radial electric field</p>
<p> And so an isolated positive charge always has electric field lines going away from it. Whereas, a negative charge always have field lines directed towards the charge but, what is an electric field and these lines!</p>
<img src = "../../Imagedata/Physics/chargefields.png" alt="Electric field lines around a positive and negative charge">
<br id="reference87">
<h2>Electric field </h2>
<h3> A region in which a positive charge experiences a force</h3>
<p> The definition is defined for a standard charge (+). Alse this region is  not visible but, we represent them using electric field lines</p>
<p> You will need to know some basic principles of electric field lines</p>
<ul>
<li>The direction of electric field lines</li>
<p> The direction actually shows the direction of the force which a positive charge experiences ( as according to the definition ). So we actually place
an imaginary positive charge to show the force it experiences at that <span class="highlight">particular</span> point. This is because, most electric fields are not uniform!</p>
<img src ="../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldspositive.png" alt="A force experience by a positive charge around another positive charge">
<p> For example below, we see that a positive charge q  experiences a force F. So when we change the position of the charge it experiences a different force</p>
<img src ="../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldpositivedifferent.png" alt="the postive charge experiences a difference force at a different point or place in the electric field">
<li> The spacing between the electric field lines show us the strength of the field</li>
<p> So actually when the lines are more closer, a greater force per charge is  experienced compared to the same charge in a more spaced electric field lines</p>
<p> When the electric field is said to be uniform. The force remains the same at any point</p>
<br id="reference88">
<h2>Electric field Strength</h2>
<h3>It is the force acting on per unit positive charge</h3>
<p> Again by definition, it's defined for a positive charge. This is very important as this shows that the direction of the electric field is in the same direction as the force experienced by a positive charge. This makes sense because, electric fields are from positive to negative. The positive charge always moves towards the negative plate.</p>
<h4>E = F/q</h4>
<p> The idea is very simple. If we want to find the electric field at a point, we find the force acting on that particular charge per unit charge</p>
<p>Say a charge Q has an electric field around it  and another charge q is placed in that field. The charge q experiences a force F. So what is the electric field strength exerted by charge Q?</p>
<p> Now we need to understand that Electric field strength is the force acting on per unit specified charge. The force F per unit charge q gives the electric field strength of the Charge Q. This is very confusing but, actually it's simple.</p>
<p> Think of yourself and the earth. You have a weight or Gravitational force exerted on you and to find the gravitational field strength g. We just need to divide the gravitational force over mass.</p>
<h4>g = gravitational force/m</h4>
<p>However, we calculate gravitational force or weight using g again but, in A2 this is not the case and there is a different way of calculating gravitational force known as Newton's universal law of gravity. Likewise, Electrostatic force is calculated using Columb's law which will be covered in A2</p>
<p> So simply to find the electric field strength we need to divide the force/charge</p>
<h4>Electric field = F/q</h4>
<p> In this case, it's q and not Q. So this shows the electric field strength of Charge Q. Another way to see this is that in Columb's law we use both Q and q to calculate the force and dividing the force with q will cancel off q</p>
<h4>F/q = KQq/q</h4>
<h4>F/q = KQ</h4>
<p> This is not the equation but, a way to remember that by dividing by charge q we get the electric field strength of charge Q</p>
<p> Usually the electric field strength caused by a charge is not uniform so they may change from place to place. So the electrostatic force  changes</p>
<br>
<p> If we want to find the electric field strength of the charge q we need to divide it by the charge Q</p>
<h4>E = F/Q</h4>
<p> Because according to Newton's 3rd law both experiences the same force. So this is very important.</p>


<p> To find the electric field strength of a Charge q due to a field created by charge Q. We need to find the force acting on q and divide by q</p>
<h4>E = F/q</h4>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldnegative.png" alt="A negative charge in the electric field of  negative charge Q">
<h2>E - Vector?</h2>
<p> Electric field strength is actually a vector just like g.</p>
<p> Actually when we define the direction of the electric field as positive, we use a positive charge. This literally means this particular charge experiences a force from positive to negative direction - which is in the same direction as the electric field</p>
<h4>Eq = F</h4>
<p>If the electric field strength was 2000NC<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p> What is the force experienced on an electron?</p>
<h4>2000NC<sup>-1</sup> * -1.6*10<sup>-19</sup> = -3.2*10<sup>-16</sup>N</h4>
<p> So the force is negative and so this is realistic as Electric fields are always from + to - . The force is towards - from + (opposite) as electrons are negatively charged</p>
<p>In my opinion, just remember electric fields moves from positive to negative and this direction is positively defined. And so a positive charge will experience a positive force(same direction) and a negative charge expereinces a negative force(opposite)</p>
<br id="reference89">
<h2>Uniform electric field</h2>
<p>So when you have two parallel positive and negative plates. There will be a uniform electric field.</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/uniformelectricfield.gif" alt="Two parallel and opposite charged plates which have a uniform electric field">
<p>We show it by using:</p>
<ul>
<li>parallel lines</li>
<li>Equal spacing</li>
</ul>
<p>So when the electric field strength is constant or uniform we get the same force acting on the charge anywhere(if the same charge is used)</p>
<p>This is very useful as there will be calculations on the projectile of electrons and its motions because, the force or the acceleration remains constant.</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/electronprojectile.jpg" alt="projectiles of electrons in an uniform electric field">
<p>So we can calculate the force acting on the charge and find the acceleration</p>
<h4>Acceleration = Force/mass</h4>
<p>Usually the weight of the electron is very small so we neglet it and we just use the electro static force.</p>
<p> So after finding the acceleration, we can use the 4 equations of motion to predict the electrons projectile</p>
<p> This is very similar to like a ball being thrown and predicting its motion</p>
<br id="reference90">
<h2>Uniform Electric field strengths </h2>
<p>Usually, we need to calculate the electric field strength caused by two plates. When we connect the two plates to a circuit one plate becomes positive and the other one becomes negative.</p>
<p>So usually the higher potential will be positve and the lower potential is negative.</p>
<p>So we can calculate the potential difference between these two plates like the below one</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/electriccalcfield.gif" alt="how to calculate the electric field strength of a two potential plates">
<p>The magnitude of this potential difference and also the seperation d of the two plates will determine the electric field strength </p>
<h4>E = &#8710;V/d</h4>
<p>To make it  simpler, just take the difference in potential differences and divide it by d. And always remember electric fields are from the higher voltage to lower voltage.</p>
<p>For example, one plate has a voltage of 100v and the other one -100v, both were separated by a distance of 10mm. Find E</p>
<h4>E = &#8710;V/d</h4>
<h4>E = 100-(-100)/(10&divide;1000)</h4>
<h4>E = 200/(10&divide;1000)</h4>
<h4>E = 20000Vm<sup>-1</sup></h4>
<h2>Linking these 2 Equations</h2>
<h4>E = F/Q</h4>
<h4>E = &#8710;V/d</h4>
<p> Both have the same E</p>
<h4>F/Q = &#8710;V/d</h4>
<p> So by knowing the potential difference and the distance we can find the force acting on a particular charge</p>
<h4>F = QV/d</h4>
<p> And thus find the acceleration</p>
<br id="reference91">
<h2>Work done</h2>
<p>To calculate the work done by the electric field on the charge is very simple and we know:</p>
<h4> Work done = Fs</h4>
<p> So using this equation:</p>
<h4>F = QV/d</h4>
<p> We can get :</p>
<h4>Fs = QV</h4>
<figcaption>As s is the same as d </figcaption>
<p> In fact, the work done by the electric field on a charge is QV </p>
<p> This is also an important truth as work done in circuits is same as:</p>
<h4>Work done = eV</h4>
<p>Because emf is defined as the work done per unit charge</p>
<p> There is another way of calculating the work done by the electric field and that's by checking how much Kinetic energy the charge has gained.</p>
<p>This requires the equations of motion to calculate the final speed and all which is quite complex.</p>
<p> It's much easier to use</p>
<h4>W = QV</h4>
<p> But remember, this is the work done in order to move the charge from one plate to another. So if we need to find the work done to move a charge from the center to one of the plates we need to half the work done by the equation.</p>
<p> Lastly, this idea of eV is heavily used in radioactive physics as it is the work done when an electron moves in a potential difference of 1 volt. This is known as electronvolts and this also measures energy.</p>
