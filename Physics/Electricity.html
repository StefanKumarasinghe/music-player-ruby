<h1>Voltage, Current, Resistance & More</h2>
<br id ="reference92">
<h2>Current</h2>
<h3>The rate of flow of electric charge past a point</h3>
<p>So whenever a charge moves from one place to another there is always a current produced. So the charge could either be positive or negative.</p>
<h4>Current = charge/time</h4>
<h4>I = Q/t</h4>
<p>So 1 Coloumb of charge is passed a point when a circuit of 1A is switched on 1 Sec</p>
<p>Current is a base quantity which has a unit of ampere</p>
<p>So if we know how many charges are passing a point per second we can find the current</p>
<p>But you need to note this!</p>
<p>The smallest unit of charge is called e which has a magnitude of 1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C. This could be an electron or a positive charge</p>
<h4>e = 1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C</h4>
<p> This is known as the elementary charge as this is the smallest magnitude of charge which can exist on its own. You need to remember this value.</p>
<p>So all other total charges must be a multiple of e</p>
<h4> Charge = N*e</h4>
<p>For example, a charge of 2.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C does not exist as n would be not a whole number.</p>
<p>However, a charge of 4.8*10<sup>-19</sup>C is possible as it takes 3 elementary charge particles to give this charge</p>
<p> So there is another indirect equation for current</p>
<h4>Current = Ne/t</h4>
<p>So in ciruits, we always have electrons moving which has a charge of -e</p>
<p>So some questions will ask the total number of electrons passing a point and so they will give the current and the total time</p>
<h4>Q = It</h4>
<p>This will give us the total charge passed a point and we know the total charge is a multiple of e</p>
<p>Number of electrons(N) = Total charge / e</p>
<h2>+e and -e </h2>
<p>So what is -e ? These are known as particles which have a charge of -1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C. This is actually an electron and so it is negatively charged</p>
<p>So what is +e? These are known as particles which have a charge of +1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C. This is actually known as a proton or a positive ion</p>
<p>So usually if you have a charge of +10e, It means you have 10*1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C = 1.6*10<sup>-18</sup>C</p>
<br id ="reference93">
<h2>Conventional current</h2>
<p>So the standard way of defining the direction of  current is the flow of  positive charge, and not  negative charge</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/conventional-flow-notation.jpg" alt="The directionof how current flow in a circuit. This is known as conventional current">
<p> So for example if we have a circuit as above, current should move from + to - . As the positive charge is repelled from the positive terminal and attracted towards the negative terminal. But this is not the case.
So by definition current flows from + to -, but, in a circuit positive charges can't flow. It's the delocalised electron which flows in the metal or the conductor</p>
<p>Electrons are negative and it actually moves the opposite direction of current(from - to +)</p>
<p>This is because conventional current is defined for positive current</p>
<h2>Structure of a conductor</h2>
<img src = "../../Imagedata/Physics/conductor.jpg" alt="The structure of a metal which contains a sea delocalised electrons and positive cations">

<p> You will need to know some new terms</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduction electrons</li>
<p>As you see in the metallic bonding, the structure contains free moving/delocalised electrons which are called conduction electrons</p>
<p> So When you have more electrons obviously the current would be greater as more number of charges will be moving per sec</p>
<li>Number density</li>
<p> This is actually the number of conduction electrons per unit volume</p>
<h4>Number density = Number of conduction electrons / volume</h4>
<p> Remember n is not N </p>
<li>Mean drift velocity</li>
<p> The average velocity of the moving conduction electrons</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>I = nAve</h2>
<p> So now we will find another equation of current which is actually derived</p>
<h4>Current = Number density * Area * Mean drift velocity * Elementary charge</h4>
<h4>I = nAvq</h4>
<p> So the q is actually the magnitude of a single charge of a particle but, as this equation is mainly used in wires we use:</p>
<h4>I = nAve</h4>
<p> where e is 1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C.</p>
<p> However, this equation could be used in any situation for example the ions in an electrolyte</p>
<h2> Derivation</h2>
<p> This is important as it helps you to recall the equation when you forget</p>
<p>So we know the Number Density * Volume would give us the number of conduction electrons</p>

<h4>Number density = Number of conduction electrons / volume</h4>
<h4> Number of Conduction electrons = Number density * Volume</h4>
<p> And we know Volume is area * height</p>
<p> So multiplying Number density with area give us the number of conduction electrons per meter</p>
<h4>E per meter = Number density * Area</h4>
<p> Then we multiply it by the velocity(distance moved per sec)</p>
<p> So now this gives us  the number of conduction electrons per unit time</p>
<h4>Conduction electron per unit time = nAv</h4>
<p> As each electron has a charge of e, we multiply it to get the total charge moved per unit time</p>
<h4>Total charge per unit time = nAve</h4>
<p> Which is the same as current as:</p>
<h4>I = Q/t</h4>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p> Using this equation, we can show how one factor affects current or another factor</p>
<h4>I = nAve</h4>

<h4>I &prop; n</h4>
<p>When Number density increases, this means there are more electrons per unit volume so more  charge can be carried per unit time</p>
<p> This is why metals are good conductors as the have a high number of n</p>
<p> In fact, the number Density is actually a constant for a particular material at a particular temperature. So Area and the mean drift velocity determines the current</p>
<h4>I &prop; A</h4>
<p> Greater area means more charges can flow and also less resistance</p>
<h4>I &prop; v</h4>
<p> Faster they move, the more charges pass per unit time</p>

<h4>n &prop; 1/v</h4>
<p> As n is usually a constant, greater n  for the same current means that the drift velocity is less because, there are more electrons so it's harder to move. Think of a traffic road!</p>
<h4>A &prop; 1/v</h4>
<p>Greater the area, the slower the electrons  move. Think of a river flowing! If it passes through a narrow pipe and if it were to transport the same amount of water, the water needs to travel fast</p>
<h2>Voltage</h2>
<p>The general idea is that work is done per unit change or there is a change in potential energy for carrying a unit charge</p>
<p>Remember the current and voltage has the same direction. This is because, voltage flows from the most potential to the least potential. This idea is needed in order to calculate the potential difference</p>
<br id ="reference94">
<h2>Electromotive force EMF</h2>
<p>This is not a force but, a specific term under voltage</p>
<h3>The energy transformed by a cell from chemical to electrical energy in carrying a unit charge across the complete circuit</h3>
<h4>Emf = Workdone/Charge</h4>
<h4>V = W/Q</h4>
<p>Just notice this is the complete energy provided by the battery and so emf is the total voltage provided by the battery</p>
<p> Also when electrons are moved from the negative terminal to the positve terminal, energy is released and so the energy must be used up and converted to other forms of energy, this is known as p.d</p>
<h2>Potential difference</h2>
<h3>The energy transformed from electric to other forms of energy when driving a unit charge between two points in a circuit</h3>
<h4>P.d = Workdone/Charge</h4>
<p>This work done is more specific and is the work done by a component such as a bulb</p>
<p>By assumption, wires don't carry any resistance. So no work is done against it and lost in the form of heat</p>
<p>There is an important point to recognise that the direction matters. For example,  at the start of the circuit the potential (voltage) is almost same as the EMF 10v ( Assuming no internal resistance ).
So the voltage before passing through the component has a electron potential of 10 v and the component has a p.d of 2v. The voltage after the component will be 8v. This  idea of conserving energy as the energy lost 2J/c reduce the potential energy by 2J for each unit of charge</p>
<p>And the total energy of the battery must be eventually converted to other forms of energy</p>
<h4>EMF = Total P.d</h4>
<br id ="reference95">
<h2>Resistance</h2>
<h3> It is the potential difference per unit current</p>
<p> SI units: Ohms 	&#937;</p>
<h4>Resistance = Voltage/Current</h4>
<p> Resistance is applied in different situations. For example, the resistance of the whole circuit would be the Total voltage/Total current. Or it could be the resistance of a component which is the Potential difference across that component per unit current</p>
<p> We will state the equation used to find the resistance of a component</p>
<h4>Resistance = P.D / current</h4>
<p> Why is there resistance? As electrons flow through the haphazard journey, they collide with vibrating cations and electrons and so they lose energy and release heat energy</p>
<p>Resistance is usually fixed for a component but, changes with length and other factors</p>
<p> How to calculate resistance in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Series</li>
<p>We just add the resistance together!</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/resistance-series-circuit.gif" alt="This is adding resistance in a series circuit">
<h4>R<sub>Total</sub> = R<sub>1</sub>+ R<sub>2</sub> +..
<h4>2&#937; + 3&#937; +4&#937; = 9&#937;</h4>
<li>parallel</li>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/parallelresistance.gif" alt="This is adding resistance in a parallel circuits">
<h4>1/R<sub>total</sub> = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub></h4>
<p>Don't forget that after finding the total of the reciprocals, we need to find the reciprocal at the end.</p>
</ul>
<br id ="reference96">
<h2>Power</h2>
<h4>Power = Energy/time</h4>
<p> We can find power in terms of V and I</p>
<h4>Power = Voltage * Current</h4>
<h4>P = VI</h4>
<p> There is another equation in terms of I and R only</p>
<h4>Power = I<sup>2</sup>R</h4>
<p> And only in terms of V and R </p>
<h4>Power = V<sup>2</sup>/R</h4>
<p> You need to know all these equations as they might ask to find the ratio of power between two objects</p>
<p> For example, they might say the power is the same. What is the ratio between the R<sub>x</sub>/R<sub>y</sub>?</p>
<h4>V<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub>/R<sub>x</sub> = V<sup>2</sup><sub>y</sub>/R<sub>y</sub></h4>
<h4>V<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub>/V<sup>2</sup><sub>y = </sub>R<sub>x</sub>/R<sub>y</sub></h4>
<p> Watch out that the We MUST use V<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub> and not V<sub>x</sub></p>
<h2>Current in a ciruit</h2>
<p> So how do we find the current around the circuit. We need to some things:</p>
<ul>
<li> Current in a series remains the same everywhere.</li>
<p> Why? Think about it. The battery pumps out a certain amount of electrons and  also it collects the electrons at the positive terminal. So electrons given must equal to the electrons collected. And this is must be the same rate. So the current remains the same at the point it is given out by the battery and at the point taken in by the battery.</p>
<p> So all the components in the circuit has the same current. If they are in series only.</p>
<li>Current in a parallel splits</li>
<p> This idea is very simple. When there are two or more paths available, the current splits and it depends on the resistance. More current always flows through the path which has the lowest resistance</p>
<p> But Remember this! When the parallel circuit joins to the main circuit again, the current must be the same as what was entered - this is known as Kirchoff's first law</p>
<h2>Voltage in a circuit</h2>
<p> We also need to know some basics</p>
<li>Voltage splits in series, depending on the individual resistance</li>
<p>Why? When charge passes through a circuit it loses energy.</p>
<p>So we need to know that when you have more resistance, the greater potential difference it takes</p>
<h4>V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> * R<sub>1</sub>/ R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p> So this is actually a ratio of a particular resistance compared to the total resistance of the circuit</p>
<h4>R<sub>1</sub>/ R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub></h4>
<p> This gives us a good relationship that when Resistance increases so does the P.D - Remember this by no means!</p>
<h4>Voltage &prop; Resistance</h4>
<li>Voltage remains the same in parallel circuits</li>
<p> This idea confuses many but, there is a simple way to tackle this. We Know that at the start of the circuit the potential is the Emf and as there are components, the potential decreases</p>
<p> Now in parallel, 2 or more wires are connected to the same point so they both have the same starting potentials and also ends at the same point. So as the potential difference is the same, they must have the same voltage</p>
<p>Most of the time, Wires do not have any resistance and so adding wires to the same point does not change the potential of the wire.</p>
<p>This idea must be fully understood as it is a basis used in many questions and concepts - such as the bridge wheatstone concept</p>
<br id ="reference97">
<h2>Resistivity</h2>
<h3> It is the resistance of a particular material of unit length and unit cross-sectional area at a standard temperature</h3>
<p>SI units: &#937;m </p>
<p>So this is actually unique for a particular material at a constant temperature.</p>
<p>We know that resistance increases when the length of the material increases.</p>
<h4>R &prop; L</h4>
<p> We know that when the cross-sectional area increases, the resistance decrease. Why? Because more area means greater charge can pass through per unit time</p>
<h4>R &prop; 1/A</h4>
<p> So we combine to form:</p>
<h4>R &prop; L/A</h4>
<p>So we can add a constant, which is called resistivity</p>
<h4> Resistance = Resistivity * Length / Area</h4>
<h4>R = PL/A</h4>
<p>So we can find the value of resistivity of a material</p>
<h4>P = RA/L</h4>
<p> Remember that resistivity is a constant just like young modulus and Number density</p>
<h2>Resistivity and Number density</h2>
<p> There is a clear link between the number density of a material and its resistivity</p>
<h4>P &prop; 1/n</h4>
<p>As there is more conduction electrons per unit volume, it can carry more current and we know when current increases, resistance decreases</p>
<p>There is also two thing you need to remember:</p>
<p>Impure metals always have a higher resistivity but, they also follow the equation. Also the resistivity of a material increases with the temperature</p>
<h4>Resistivity &prop; Temperature</h4>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/resistivitygraph.png" alt="How resistivity changes with temperature. This is a resistivity-temperature graph!">
<h2>MCQ techniques</h2>
<p>There are some fast methods to solve some questions.</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/halfresistance.gif" alt="A quick and easy method for 9702 past papers. The resistance of two identical resistors is always half of one resistor">
<p>This shows that if we have two identical resistors, the combined resistance is always half of one of the resistor value</p>
<p>But also this applies for any number of identical resistors in a parallel circuit</p>
<h4>Resistance<sub>combined</sub> = Resistance of a resistor/Number of resistors</h4>
<h4>R<sub>combined</sub> = R/n</h4>
