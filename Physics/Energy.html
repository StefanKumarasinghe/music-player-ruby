<h1>Energy, Power & Efficiency</h1>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>We define energy as the abilty to do work. This might seem very misleading because, we can waste alot of energy without doing proper work. We will see below what is work done! Also you need to know that Energy is not a thing but, a concept in Physics. We can not prove that energy is always conserved, we just believe it!</p>
<p>SI Units: Joules (J)</p>
<br id="reference31">
<h2>Law of conservation of energy</h2>
<h3> Energy can not be destroyed or created but, can transform from one form of energy to another form</h3>
<br id="reference32">
<h2>Work done</h1>
<h3> Is the force times the displacement moved in the direction of the force</h3>
<h4>Work done = Force * Displacement</h4>
<h4>W = Fs</h4>
<p> So if we need to find the work done on a particular object, we find the force of that <span class="highlight">specific</span> work</p>
<p>What do I mean by specific work? Well, let us take an example:</p>
<p>We carry an object from the ground to a certain height</p>
<p>We know that we have done work <span class="highlight">against</span> gravity to carry the object - usually exams ask this specific work done. But when you are carrying the object, you may have done work against many other forces such as air resistance and more. We do not count this as this is called the total work done. We will see this later</p>
<p>Another example is the work done against friction. It is  the frictional force * displacement moved </p>
<p>So the work done by a particular force (<span class="highlight">useful</span> work done) is the <span class="highlight">specific</span> force times the displacement of the direction of the force</p>

<p>Let us see a worked example:</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/workdoneex.jpg" alt="How to calculate work done on a object by resolving and finding the force in the direction of the object moved">
<figcaption>As you can see, we find the force which is in the direction which the object moves. This is done by resolving and using cos&theta;</figcaption>
<br id="reference33">
<h2>Kinetic Energy</h2>
<h3>Energy possessed by moving objects</h3>
<h4>Kinetic energy = ½*Mass*(velocity)<sup>2</sup></h4>
<h4>KE = ½mv<sup>2</sup></h4>
<p>Derivation is not required but, good to remember!</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/derivationke.jpg" alt="The derivation of kinetic energy from the equations of motion">
<figcaption>Physics MCQs might ask this! So it is better to know the concept of the derivation</figcaption>
<br id="reference34">
<h2>Gravitational potential energy<h2>
<h3>Energy possessed by objects in high positions</h3>
<h4>G.P.E = Mass*g*height</h4>
<h4>Gpe = mgh</h4>
<p>So because g is usually uniform for a small change in height - 9.81 is ok</p>
<h2>Link between GPE and KE</h2>
<p>Assuming all the gpe  is converted to KE, for example a ball rolling down from a high position to a lower position (100% efficient)</p>
<p> We can say the Gpe=KE</p>

<h4>mgh = ½m *v<sup>2</sup></h4>
<figcaption>Most questions assume you to know this equation when they say the phrase "no energy was lost"</figcaption>
<p>By cancelling m both sides and making v the subject</p>
<h4>2gh = v<sup>2</sup></h4>
<h4>(2gh)<sup>1/2</sup> = v</h4>
<h4>&Sqrt;(2gh) = v</h4>
<p>To equation states that when an object of <span class="highlight">any</span> mass falls from a particular height, they will always be converted to the same velocity</p>
<p>Why? Logically speaking, we know that if we drop a very heavy ball and feather in a vacuum both have the same acceleration and velocity at the bottom, irrespective of their masses</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/energyex.jpg" alt="Cambridge alevel physics revision notes -  a past paper question on energy 9702">
<p>And another example in the form of a pendulum:</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/energyex2.jpg" alt="Cambridge alevel physics revision notes - a past paper question on energy 9702, pendulum energy">


<h2>More questions and demonstrations</h2>
<p>This chapter requires a lot logic and so we will ask you to <a href="https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=ca_b53EQU8w&list=PLfh04WZ4q7nWCSB_LgtCO80tB5B9EBD3a&index=3">watch</a> this recommended video by Revise Zone to understand the topic more.</p>
<div class="noteparagraphgreen">
<p>Revise Zone is planning to make concise short videos for each chapter, explaining the notes and trying out some tricky and hard past paper questions. We hope you do enjoy this amazing free platform!</p>
</div>
<br id="reference35">
<h2>Power</h2>
<h3>The rate at which work is done or energy is transformed</h3>
<p>SI units: Watts </p>
<p> We use Watts as the units instead of Js<sup>-1</sup></p>
<h4>Power = Energy/time</h4>
<p>or</p>
<h4>Power = Work done / time </h4>
<h4> P = W/t </h4>
<p> There are actually alot of equations for power</p>
<p>Energy transformed is the same as work done - for example, if we push an object, we move the object using chemical energy, so energy is actually transformed from one form to another!</p>
<h4>Work done = Energy transformed</h4>
<p> However, we usually consider the useful work done because more work is actually used. This is because, nothing is  fully efficient. So the power we need to do the <span class="highlight">specific</span> work get is called Mechanical power or required/useful power</p>
<p>The total power is always higher!</p>
<br id="reference36">
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>It is a very straight forward concept and it shows out of the total work done or power what percentage is useful</p>
<h4>Efficiency = useful workdone/ total work done </h4>
<h4>Efficiency = useful power/ total power</h4>
<p>Efficiency is usually expressed in terms of percentage so we multiply by 100</p>
<h4>Efficiency = (useful workdone/ total work done) * 100</h4>
<p> So this is how the exam will ask the question</p>
<blockquote>The efficiency of the system is 30%, The elevator carries a load of 1000N for 2m for every second. Calculate the total power?</blockquote>
<p> So that energy we have to calculate is actually the total power, so it is pretty straight forward. Just make the total power the subject</p>
<p>The mechanical power is the power required to do the work</p>
<h4>W = Fs</h4>
<h4>P = W/t</h4>
<p>As it is for every second, the work done is equal to the power</p>
<h4>1000*2 = 2000J every second</h4>
<p>Then use the efficiency equation and make the total power the subject</p>

<h2>Power of a constant velocity</h2>
<p>By law, we don't need to supply energy to keep an object moving in a constant velocity but, in day to day life, we need energy to keep an object moving at constant velocity as there is frictional
force acting on the object. For example, if a car was moving at constant velocity (say top speed). We need to keep on pedalling the engine, so the engine provides a constant power</p>
<p>Power at a constant speed is given by:</p>
<h4> Power = Force * Velocity </h4>
<h4> P = Fv </h4>
<h3> The force used could be the friction or the engine thrust as both are same!</h3>
<p> This shows the power done by the engine is converted to heat <span class="highlight">ONLY</span> and not to kinetic energy </p>
<p> This is actually an important conversion in terminal velocity - the energy is converted to heat only.</p>
<p> If it's accelerating, it's converted to both KE and HEAT</p>
<p> Watch out! They might ask it in different ways.</p>
<br id="reference37">
<h2>Work done by Gases</h2>
<p> We know that gases can exert pressure and so they apply a contant force per unit area.</p>
<p>Let's take the below gas syringe:</p>
<p>It has some pressure greater  than the atmospheric pressure. Logic tells us that the gas syringe should expand until the internal pressure is equal to the outer pressure. In
other words, the outer force must equal to the internal force as the area is same.</p>
<p> So when the volume increases, a force is exerted for a particular displacement</p>
<h4>Work done = Fs</h4>
<h4>Force = Pressure * area</h4>
<h4>Workdone = Pressure * area * s</h4>
<h4>Workdone = Pressure * change in volume</h4>
 <h4>W = P&#8710;V</h4>
 <img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/pressurework.jpg" alt="Cambridge alevel physics revision notes - work done by a gas syringe by expanding the gas">
<p>We use change in volume because, we take the change in displacement.</p>
<p>So what is this pressure?</p>
<p> Now for the gas syringe to expand, it must do work against the atmospheric pressure</p>
<h4>Pressure = 1 atm or 10<sup>5</sup>Nm<sup>-2</sup></h4>
<p>So actually the work done by the expansion of the gas is the work done against the atmospheric pressure</p>
<p> For example, if a gas syringe expands by a volume of 2m<sup>3</sup>, the work done is equal to 10<sup>5</sup> * 2 = 200000J</p>
<p>Remember that volume is in m<sup>3</sup></p>
<p> Another point to remember is that this is the energy required just to expand the gas ONLY. Not to push any weight or mass/accelerate. So if there is a mass on top. Work done on rising the mass and the expanding the gas is more.</p>
