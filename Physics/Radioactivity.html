<h1>Radioactive Physics - Alpha, Beta & Gamma Radiation</h2>
<br id="reference109">
<h2>Nucleur model of an atom</h2> 
<p>Scientist used to believe that the atom was a neutral charged object which had negative charges evenly spaced</p>
<p>This was known as the plum pudding model</p>
<p>However, Scientists  realised that the atom follows a different model and this was proven by Rutherford's alpha scattering experiment</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/Rutherford-Experiment1.png"alt="A diagram of rutherford's alpha scattering experiment which shows how alpha particles are deflected">
<p>Alpha particles where ejected towards a thin gold leaf and there were different observations</p>
<p>The observations of this experiment must be remembered.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Most</span> of the particles passed straight through the gold leaf</li>
<p>This is because, the atom is mostly empty space and this also shows that the positive & negative charges are not evenly spaced.</p>
<li>Few were deflected by a slight angle of less than 90&deg;</li>
<p>This is because when the alpha particles passes near the nucleus they are deflected by a bit. This shows the nucleus is positively charged and so the alpha particles
 +2 experiences a repulsive force</p>
<li><span class="highlight">Very few</span> only deflected completely or by an angle over 90&deg;</li>
<p>This is around 1/20000 alpha particles and this shows that the nucleus of an atom is so tiny and densed at the center and positively charged. When alpha particle collide head on or sideways to the nucleus, they will deflect by an angle more that 90&deg;</p>
<h2>Deflection diagrams</h2>
<p> You will need to know how to draw  some of these deflections</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/deflections1.png" alt="deflection of alpha particles in a atom and by the plum pudding model">
<p>1. Most pass through without any deflection</p>
<p>2. Some pass with little deflection</p>
<p>3. Very few pass with a large deflections especially when the alpha particle collides with the tiny positive nucleus</p> 
<p>Also compare the idea of the plum pudding model and Rutherford's experiment.</p>
<h2>Basic Definitions</h2>
<p>You will need to know some basic terms of an atom </p>
<p>Let us first see the structure of an atom</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/atomstructure.jpg" alt="structure of an atom with electrons and nucleus. A labelled atom">
<br id="reference110">
<h2>Nucleus</h2>
<p>It contains both neutrons and protons of the atom and so it's positively charged. Why? This is because, neutrons are neutral and protons are positively charged. The nucleus is very small and highly densed and is at the center of the atom.</p>
<br id="reference111">
<h2>Electrons</h2>
<p>These are known to be fundamental particles which orbit around the nucleus of an atom in energy levels. If you need to know more go to the leptons section.</p>
<h2> The Key</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/periodkey.png" alt="A period key to identify the atomic number and mass number of an atom">
<br id="reference112">
<h2>Atomic Number ( Z )</h2>
<h3>The total number of protons in the nucleus of an atom</h3>
<p>The proton number of an atom identifies the element. This is a fundamental fact and this proves that isotopes are of the same element</p>
<br id="reference113">
<h2>Mass Number ( A )</h2>
<h3>The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom</h3>
<p>It is the same as the nucleon number</p>
<p>Particles in the nucleus of an atom are called nucleons. So if there are 7 protons and 8 neutrons, it has 15 nucleons.</p>
<br id="reference114">
<h2>Isotopes</h2>

<h3>Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but, different number of neutrons</h3>
<p>The definition defines only atoms and not for ions</p>
<p>So really we usually compare atoms rather than ions so that's why isotopes usually have the same chemical properties because, they have the same number of electrons in the valence shell</p>
<p>However, the physical properties will be different such as the melting point and the density</p>
<p>This is because, the Physical properties depends on the nucleur properties of an atom and the number of electrons determine the chemical properties</p>
<br>
<p> So isotopes are always neutral and have the same proton number but,  have different neutron or mass number</p>
<br id="reference115">
<h2>Nucleur density</h2>
<h3>It is the mass of the nucleus per unit volume of the nucleus of the atom</h3>
<h4>Nucleur density = Mass/Volume</h4>
<p> To calculate the mass of the nucleus, we must find the total number of neutrons and protons (nucleon number). We also need to remember that the mass of a proton is same as the mass
of a neutron and it is 1.67*10<sup>-27</sup>kg</p>
<p>So we Multiply to find the total mass</p>
<h4>Mass of nucleus = Nucleon number * 1.67*10<sup>-27</sup>kg</h4>
<p>To find the volume of the nucleus, we need to to know the diameter of a typical nucleus is 10<sup>-15</sup>m. Most of the time they will give it.</p>
<h4>Volume = 4/3 * &pi;r<sup>3</sup></h4>
<h4>Nucleur density = Mass/volume</h4>
<p>You will notice something. That the density is extremely high. This is because, the nucleus is strongly packed using strong nucleur force. But why is the real density way less than the nucleur
density?</p>
<p>This is also because, the atom is mostly empty space and so combining the density of the empty space and the tiny densed nucleus will give an overall density which is alot less</p>
<br id="reference116">
<h2>Radioactive decay</h2>
<h3>It is the spontaneous random decay of a unstable nucleus by emiting ionising radiation inorder to be stable</h3>
<p>These release radiations such as alpha beta and gamma radiation.</p>
<p>We will need to know some terms</p>
<ul>
<br id="reference117">
<li>Random</li>
<p>The time taken for a particle to decay is unknown or random. However, as an overall picture, the average time can be found by using the Decay constant</p>
<br id="reference118">
<li>Spontaneous</li>
<p>The rate of the decay is not affected by external factors such as temperature</p>
<br id="reference119">
<li>Ionisation</li>
<p>The ability to strip electrons from a gas molecule to form gaseous ions</p>
<p>Remember that a particle can ionise another atom if it has sufficient energy or charge</p>

<li>Penetration</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability for a radiation to pass through materials</p>
<br id="reference120">
<h2>Laws conserved during decay</h2>
<p>So what laws are conserved during decay:</p>
<ul>

<li>Law of conservation of charge and nucleon number</li>

<li>Law of conservation of Mass-energy</li>
<p>So at both sides the mass-energy is conserved. The products usually have less mass than the reactants but, the fast moving Beta particle(or any radiation) is created. The energy due to this kinetic energy compensates this loss in mass. This is called the mass-energy conservation.</p>
<li>Law of conservation of momentum</li>
<p>Usually we don't see this in normal equations but, momentum is always conserved.</p>
<h2>Types of radiation</h2>
<p>There are 3 types of radiation we must know and their characteristics</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th> Type</th>
<th>Nucleur symbol</th>
<th>Nature of radiation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alpha radiation</td>
<td>He - 4 or  <sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>&alpha;</td>
<td>It's a helium nucleus with 2 protons and 2 neutrons</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta radiation</td>
<td>- e or  <sup>0</sup><sub>-1</sub>&beta;</td>
<td>It is a fast moving electron</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma radiation</td>
<td>&gamma;</td>
<td>It is a high frequency electromagnetic wave or a gamma photon</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now we will check their ionisation and penetration</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th> Type</th>
<th>Ionisation</th>
<th>Penetration</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alpha radiation</td>
<td>Greatest ionisation</td>
<td>Lowest penetration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta radiation</td>
<td>Medium ionisation</td>
<td>Medium penetration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma radiation</td>
<td>Least Ionisation</td>
<td>Highest penetration</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Alpha has the lowest penetration and greatest ionisation as it has the highest charge of 2+ and it is also the slowest. So it has a greater ionisation effect and because it ionises more it loses more energy and thus can't penetrate far.
Also alpha particles are stopped by a few cm of air or a sheet of paper or skin</p>
<p>Beta has medium penetration and ionisation as it is charged but, way faster. So it has greater penetration. It is stopped by few cm of aluminum</p>
<p>Gamma has the least ionisation and due to this, it has  the greatest penetration. It is never truly stopped but, reduced almost completely by  some cm of lead or  few meters of concrete</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/penetration.jpg" alt="The pentrations of alpha and beta and gamma radiation. Gamma is stopped by a block of lead. Beta is stopped by a block of aluminium. Alpha is stopped by a sheet of paper">
<br>

<p>We will see some more details</p>
<table class="table-design">
<tr>
<th> Type</th>
<th>Speed in terms of c</th>
<th>KE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alpha radiation</td>
<td>5%c</td>
<td>More than &beta;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta radiation</td>
<td>99%c</td>
<td>Range of KE as due to range of speeds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma radiation</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>High - depends on the frequency- usually a specific value. Whereas, beta always changes.</td>

</tr>
</table>
<br id="reference121">
<h2>Alpha decay</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/alpha-radiation.jpg" alt="a radioactive equation where alpha particle is released. The proton number decreases by 2 and the mass number decreases by 4. Total Nucleon and atomic number is conserved">
<p>Always remember that during alpha decay, the nucleon number decreases by 4 and the proton number decreases by 2.</p>
<p>And a helium - 4 nucleus is formed</p>
<br id="reference122">
<h2>Beta decay</h2>
<p>Remember that there are 2 types of beta decay so we will evaluate each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta(-) decay</li>
<p>This is usually the default decay whenever they talk about beta decay</p>

<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/betaexample.png" alt="an example of a beta minus decay where an electron and a antineutrino is formed">
<p>Always in beta(-), an neutron becomes an electron and a proton and so The Nucleon number or mass number never changes but only the proton number increases by 1 and so it becomes the next element. Also an  electron antineutrino is formed.</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/neutrontoproton.gif" alt="A weak interaction which converts down quark to an up quark">
<p>We need to know that a <span class="highlight">down quark</span> is turned into an <span class="highlight">up quark</span> due to the weak force during this process</p>
<h4>Neutron &rarr; Proton</h4>
<h4>ddu &rarr; uud </h4>
<h4>d &rarr; u</h4>
<p><a href ="#neutrino">Why?</a> was an electron antineutrino formed rather than a neutrino?</p>
<li>Beta(+) decay</li>
<p>In this a proton is converted to a neutron and a positron and a electron neutrino</p>
<img src ="../../Imagedata/Physics/beta(+)decay.png" alt="a beta positive decay or a positron emission where an neutrino is formed">
<p>Always the Mass number remains constant in any beta decay but in beta (+) the atomic number decreases to form the stable product.</p>
<p>Also you need to know that an up quark turns into a down quark during this process</p>
<h4>Proton &rarr; Neutron</h4>
<h4>uud &rarr; ddu </h4>
<h4>u &rarr; d</p>
</ul>
<br id="reference123">
<h2>Gamma radiation</h2>
<p>There is no change in Mass number or proton number as no particles are released except energy. So this allows particles to release excess energy.</p>
<img src ="../../Imagedata/Physics/gamma-radiation.png" alt="a gamma decay where gamma photons is released">
<br id="reference124">
<h2>Magnetic fields and electric fields</h2>
<p>As gamma radiation is neutral, it is not deflected by an electric field or a magnetic field</p>
<p>Beta and alpha are deflected in an electric field</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/electricfieldradiation.gif" alt="the deflection of radiation in electric fields">
<p>Always as alpha is +2 it deflects towards the negative plate, whereas the beta particle deflects towards the positive plate. However, as beta particle has a lower mass to charge ratio, the deflection is relatively higher than alpha particle.</p>

<p>So when we usually compare the deflection of the same charge to find which one has the greater deflection we use this equation</p>
<h4>Deflection &prop; 1/(mass/charge)</h4>
<p> For example, a proton has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1</p>
<p>It has a mass to charge ratio of 1.</p>
<p>Another particle of charge +2 and a mass of 4 has a mass to charge ratio of 2</p>
<p> So relative to the first one the alpha particle has twice the mass-charge and so twice as less deflection or further apart</p>
<br>
<p>
Alpha and beta rays are both deflected in a magnetic field but, gamma rays are not deflected.</p>
<figure> 
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/magneticfieldradiation.gif" alt="The deflection of radiation in an magnetic field">
<figcaption>
Magnetic field into the page.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just imagine that alpha is current as current is the flow of positive charge.</p>
<p>Then use Fleming's left hand rule and find the direction of the motion:</p>
<p>1. The thumb is the deflection direction</p>
<p>2. The index is the direction of the magnetic field(in or out of the page).</p>
<p>3. The middle finger is the direction of the alpha particle.</p>
<p>So to find beta decay, always remember that beta deflects in the opposite direction of alpha particles and also by a larger angle</p>

<h2>Elementary particles</h2>
<p>All things are made from the smallest indivisable particles known as elementary particles</p>
<p>You will only need to know these particles:</p>
<ul>
<br id="reference125">
<li>Quarks</li>
<p>There are 6 types of quarks and you need to remember them all but, there is an easier way to remember there charges</p>
<table class="table-design">

<tr>
<td>Charge = +2e/3</td>
<td>Up Quark</td>
<td>Charm Quark</td>
<td>Top Quark</td>
</tr>
<td>Charge = -1e/3</td>
<td>Down Quark</td>
<td>Strange Quark</td>
<td>Bottom Quark</td>
</table>
<p>So what this table shows us that the particles in the first row have the same charge of +2e/3 where as the 2nd row has charges of -1e/3</p>
<p>Also remember that a quark has another similar but, opposite name like top and bottom quarks</p>
<p>Remember this table!</p>
<br>
<p>Protons and neutrons are made out of elementary particles called quarks</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/protonquark.png" alt="Quarks both up and down quarks. Up quarks have a charge of 2e/3 whereas down quark has a charge of -e/3">
<p>Remember that neutrons has 2 down quarks and 1 up quark</p>
<p>Remember that protons have 2 up quarks and 1 down quarks</p>
<p>If you do forget, use this method below!</p>
<p>Charge of a proton is +1e</p>
<h4>+1e = 2e/3 +2e/3 - 1e/3</h4>
<p>So we can find the number of up and down quarks</p>
<br id="reference126">
<li>Electron and Neutrinos</li>
<p>An electron is considered to be an elementary particle but, there are many types of electrons(actually 3 types):
<p>1. Muon</p>
<p>2. Tau </p>
<p>3. Electron</p>
<p> They all have the same charge but, we only need to know electrons</p>
<br> 
<p> And for each particle there is a corresponding neutrino</p>
<p>1. Muon Neutrino</p>
<p>2. Tau Neutrino </p>
<p>3. Electron Neutrino</p>
<p>Mostly, we talk about electrons and the electron neutrinos in beta decay only.</p>
<p>Also, Neutrinos are considered to be massless and chargeless so they don't affect the decay equation but, must be still added. This is because, it still carries a very little energy</p>
<br id="reference127">
<li>Photons </li>
<p> These are known to be called gamma photons as they are responsible for gamma radiation. Actually, gamma radiation are not just waves. According to Heinsberg's uncertainty principle, waves could be particles at the same time.</p>
<p>This radiation is responsible for pair production and annihilation of antimatter and matter</p>
<br id="reference128">
<h2> Antiparticle</h2>
<p>So for each elementary particle, you have seen there is a corresponding antiparticle which has the same mass but, Opposite charge and spin.
 When representing them we put a dash above the original symbol</p>
<p> We will give some examples</p>
<table class="table-design">

<tr>
<td>Charge = -1</td>
<td>Electron</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charge = +1</td>
<td>Positron</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> We will also check the antiparticle of neutrinos</p>
<table class="table-design">

<tr>
<td>Charge = 0</td>
<td> Electron Neutrino</td>
<td>In beta(+) decay</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charge = 0</td>
<td>Electron antineutrino</td>
<td>In beta(-) decay</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Also the antiparticle has the opposite properties</p>
<h2>Classes of Particles</h2>
<p>Particles can be classified into 2 main groups</p>
<ul>
<br id="reference129">
<li>Hadrons</li>
<p> These are large particles such as protons and neutrons and are made out of quarks</p>
<p> These particles are affected by strong nucleur force and the weak forces. Actually all types of forces.</p>
<p> Hadrons can be divided in two more groups</p>
<ul>
<li><h5>Baryons</h5></li>
<p> These are particles which contain 3 quarks together</p>
<p> For example the proton - uud</p>

<li><h5>Mesons</h5></li>
<p> These contains 2 quarks together. Usually an antiquark and a quark</p>
<p>These includes phi+ meson - up quark and antidown quark</p>
</ul>
<p> We will need to know one more thing. The baryon number in an equation is always conserved and antiparticles have the opposite  baryon number. But more information is not necessary...</p>
<br id="reference130">
<li>Leptons</li>
<p>These are electrons and neutrinos and their antiparticle</p>
<p>These particles are affected by all other forces except the strong nucleur force</p>
<br id ="neutrino">
<p> The below part is not necessary but, it can help you with identifying if a neutrino or antineutrino is produced</p>
<p>During decay, the lepton number is conserved. The antiparticles have the opposite properties, which means that an antineutrino and a positron has a lepton number of -1 whereas, neutrinos and electrons have a lepton number of 1</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/betaexample.png" alt="An example of beta decay. where an electron and antineutrino is formed">
<p>So on the left side, it only contains neutrons and protons. It has no leptons so it is 0. On the right side, it has a electron with a lepton number 1 and another lepton must be present which is a antineutrino of lepton number -1 to cancel the other lepton and equate to 0</p>
<h4>0 = +1-1</h4>
<br id="reference131">
<h2>Fundamental Forces</h2>
<p> There are 4 forces which govern the universe:</p>
<li>Gravitational Force</li>
<p>Forces between masses</p>
<p>This is the weakest force in the universe but, it also has the largest range. In fact, the range is said to be infinite!</p>
<li>Strong Nucleur Forces</li>
<p>Attraction forces which holds up the positive nucleus together. As the nucleus is made out of protons - positively charged. The strong nucleur force overcomes the repulsion forces between the protons.
<p>You will need to know some details of this force:</p>
<p>1. This is the strongest force in the universe</p>
<p>2. This doesn't affect leptons but, only Hadrons and Quarks.</p>
<p>3. This force is highly short ranged and doesn't extend to the outer shell of an atom.</p>

<li>Weak interaction or Weak force</li>
<p>All you have to know is that this force is necessary for both types of beta decay as we have seen it changes neutrons to protons</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/neutrontoproton.gif" alt="The weak force is used to convert upquarks into down quarks">
<p>To change the identity, this force is required. So this is not technically a force but, an interaction</p>

<li>Electromagnetic Force( Electrostatic force )</li>
<p>These are forces between charged objects. Anything that has a charge, creates an electric field around it and causes other charges to experience a force</p>
<br id="reference132">
<h2>Annihilation</h2>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/Electron-positron-annihilation.png" alt="annihilation of antimatter and matter release gamma radiation and energy">
<p>When a particle and the corresponding antiparticle meets, they annihilate and release energy in the form of Gamma radiation or two gamma photons</p>
<p> So Momentum, charge and mass-energy is conserved</p>
<br id="reference133">
<h2>Pair Production</h2>
<p>This is  the reverse of annihilation.</p>
<p>When a Gamma ray is passed through a nucleus, a particle and the antiparticle is formed. The nucleus is essential to conserve momentum.</p>
<img src="../../Imagedata/Physics/pairproduction.jpg" alt="pair production where gamma ray is coverted to antimatter and matter">
