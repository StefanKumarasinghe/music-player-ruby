<p>Understanding Copyrights Law is crucial especially when a site is publicly available for anyone to use. We need to understand how Copyrights Law first work and how they are applied practically.</p>

<p>Any formation of an individual work is automatically copyrighted. So they have ownership over their work and they own rights. However, these rights are less recognised by the public due to the absence of the Copyright License. There are many ways Copyrights rights could be implemented. When your work is recognised publicly by everyone as originally yours or is created by you originally, then this is formally your right. A much harder way to Copyright your work is by PURCHASING a license which many people do not do. The Copyrights License is purchased internationally for any individual property and a fee must be paid to recieve the license.</p>
<p>What you can't do is, take copyrighted documents or extracts of someone's work and use it for yourself. For example, making notes and books mainly from past papers and other sources doesnt make it your own work, according to the <a style="color:black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> law. If materials are used from other free sources, these must be also available to other organisations to copy and use. These include past papers, questions or extracted from text books etc. There is no clear evidence, whether if copying past papers is prohibited as the Cambridge board has not given clear instructions on that. However, if past papers are used to make notes and handouts, the same law applies to the person who INTIALLY copied the work. This complies only with the Internet Copyright Standards of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This does not apply to any other laws related to physical equipment such as text Books and hardcopy. However, that will be dicussed in the next point</p>
<p>Modifying a Copyrighted code or Document such as past papers does not make it original as this goes under the Plagiarism Law. Modifying words and extracts will only decrease the plagiarism level by a small amount. According to the Internet Standard, the plagiarism Percentage MUST be below 15% or it is considered to be copied. Most text books like <a style="color:black" href="http://www.redspot.com/info/terms-and-conditions-website.html">Redspot</a> and other Sources mainly base their content on past papers. However, these are licensed Copyrights and not under the copyleft law. <a style="color:black"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Fair use</a> only comes in to action only when we take SHORT extracts from other Sources and recognising it as others works ( Quoting or Citing ) . These could include again textbooks questions and quotes or 2 or 3 Pages of a Source. However, taking short extracts from different sources does not mean copyrights legistations DO NOT apply. You will be judged and approved if your work is original enough and it can not be decided by the General public, but any information from other free sources have the copyleft law applied. Watermarking other people's work does not make it yours and this has no impact on the copyleft law.</p>
<p>Here on Revise Zone, our notes are 100% original but, the past papers are free for anyone to use and the extra notes are small extracts that are under the fair use law. If a website is plagiarised and banned it will be listed in Google Black List. So eventually, the Google Algorithm will  filter off plagiarised and illegal content and the public will not be able to see it. Don't worry! If you are able to see our revision notes and past papers and more, it literally means our content is not banned. For more details go to Google Black List</p>
<p>In conclusion, we need to understand, if we use information from other free sources. In most cases, it is allowed but you can not expect your work to not used by anyone else.
