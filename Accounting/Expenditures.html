<h1>Types of Expenditures & Reciepts</h1>
<h2>Expenditures</h2>
<p>Money outflows or money spent on something</p>
<h2>Reciepts</h2>
<p>Money recieved or cash inflows</p>
<h2>Capital Expenditures</h2>
<h3>Money spent on Acquiring improving or installing a non current Assest and has a benefit of more than a year</h3>
<p>Any Capital Expenditure must be capitalised which means it must be added to the value of the non current asset</p>
<p>For example, delivery of the new non current asset must be capitalised. Any cost of Acquiring or upgrading it must be considered as a capital expenditure</p>
<h2>Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<h3>Money Spent on costs of day to day runnings of the business on resources that are used up with in a year</h3>
<p>Whenever a cost has the prefix <span class="higlight">"re"</span> such a repainting then this is a cost that is done to maintain the non current asset</p>
<p>Cost such as rent, repainting, repairment cost are revenue expenditures but cost of upgrading the non current asset such as adding a new extension is a capital expenditure</p>
<h2>Capital Reciepts</h2>
<h3>Money recieved not from normal day to day transaction but Capital Transactions</h3>
<p>This is when you recieve huge amounts of money not normally from trading activites. Examples are sale of surplus non current asset. Other common examples include introduction of new captial or obtaining a new long term loan</p>
<h2>Revenue Reciepts</h2>
<h3>Money Recieved from day to day tradings of the business</h3>
<p>These include commision, rent income etc</p>
<h2>Difference between Capital & Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<p>1. Firstly, We can talk about the definitions for each</p>
<p>2. Capital Expenditure is recorded in the Balance sheet where as Revenue expenditure is recorded in the income statement</p>
<p>3. Capital Expenditures aids profit and are not for resale and must be depreciated whereas, revenue expenditure is charged fully for that year</p>
<p>4. Capital Expenditure has a benefit of more than a year, where as revenue expenditure has a benefit of less than a year</p>
<h2>How can we identify them?</h2>
<p>For some questions, it can get confusing...</p>
<p>For example, if the engine of the motor vehicle fails and the business plans to replace it with a newer efficient engine</p>
<p>This seems to contradict with the "re" prefix but the big giveway is the efficient word and so we can consider this as an improvement thus a captial expenditure</p>
<h2>Wrong Treatments of Capital & Revenue Expenditures</h2>
<p>In some questions, the owner might have accidently recorded revenue expenditure as capital expenditure or vice versa</p>
<p>In each scenario, we need to explain the effect of the error:</p>
<p>1. If Revenue expenditure is overstated, the the expense will be overstated and profit will be understated in the income statement whereas in the balance sheet the non current assets will be understated and the capital will be understated due to profits</p>
<p>2. If Revenue expenditure is understated, the the expense will be understated and profit will be overstated in the income statement whereas in the balance sheet the non current assets will be overstated and the capital will be overstated due to profits</p>
<p>3. Also the accounting records will not show a true and fair view of accounting records and it will be inaccurate</p>
